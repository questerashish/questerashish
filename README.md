- 👋 Hi, I’m Ashish 
- 👀 I’m working in Data Science, Web Development and Algo Trading and Hobby Robotics.
- 💞️ 



I am a DIY enthusiast and a Proggrammer! . I was introduced to programming in School and I learnt C++ as my first language. I have done BSC in computer science and Btech in IT and Electronics. I love making DIY projects. My interests are Finance, Tech and Defence. I have worked on Arduino and Raspberry Pi. 
I have learnt Full Stack Development and use Python for most of my projects. I have setup my own Raspberry Pi Server with Ubuntu Server as OS. 
I am currently learning Data Science, AI and ML.
I am coding since 2011 and Trading since 2019. I have done many courses on both and have started writing my own Experiences on my website.
I am working on Projects to make my own algo trading platform. I have algo trading scripts running on Zerodha and IIFL securities.
Feel free to browse my repos, or contact for making Algo Trading Scripts. 
Wish you all Happy Learning and Growing! �
